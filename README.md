# Websites-
I am still getting the hang of web development. I will be uploading what I have done already 
This was work I did for my mentor as an assignment. I have uploaded the page source and CSS files. 
I am still getting the hang of github and how the whole world works. 
I used an html template for the website. I still have to upload other material. In the meantime, I will send pictures of what the website looks like.
